It  is  important  to  have  good  quality  images  to  allow  the  machine-learning  algorithm  to recognise stomata.

If you cannot open the link using Chrome, open in another browser e.g. Microsoft Edge. Copy the folder of the species of interest in your Google Drive. 

Each species folder contains five files: three Google Colab scripts (detection, bounding box extraction and measurement), a detection mode and a measurement model.

Stomata analysis process follows three steps: 

- Stomata detection 
- Bounding box extraction 
- Stomata measurement
